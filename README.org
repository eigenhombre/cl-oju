#+BEGIN_QUOTE
   What is /oju/? A Mysterious Sauce used as a special ingredient sourced
   (some would say pilfered) from an advanced civilization thirty years
   in the future (far beyond the late 1980's).
#+END_QUOTE

=cl-oju=: a few Clojure idioms I missed from Common Lisp (a few of which I'm
still getting used to the standard CL idiom for).

Probably there are better libraries than this you should use; in the
mean time, this package exports:

#+BEGIN_SRC
comment
drop
filter
frequencies
group-by
interleave
interpose
juxt
neg?
partial
partition-all
partition-n
pos?
rand-int
rand-nth
range
repeatedly
slurp
sort-by
spit
take
