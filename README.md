`cl-oju`: a few Clojure idioms I missed from Common Lisp (a few of which I'm
still getting used to the standard CL idiom for).

If you're coming from Clojure, it may be better to learn "the Common
Lisp way" of doing things than to rely on these functions; but this
library can still be a reference point to see *a* way of doing things
you're used to.

Note that I stick to the functional *interface* of familiar Clojure
functions, but do not worry about immutable data structures or
laziness in this library.
