`cl-oju`: a few Clojure idioms I missed from Common Lisp (a few of which I'm
still getting used to the standard CL idiom for).

Probably there are better libraries than this you should use; in the
mean time, this package exports:

    comment
    drop
    filter
    frequencies
    group-by
    interleave
    interpose
    juxt
    neg?
    partial
    partition-all
    partition-n
    pos?
    rand-int
    rand-nth
    range
    repeatedly
    slurp
    sort-by
    spit
    take
